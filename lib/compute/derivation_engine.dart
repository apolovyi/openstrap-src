// DerivationEngine — the on-device compute COORDINATOR (MAIN ISOLATE).
//
// Current flow (per trigger):
//   1. Decide WHICH calendar days need compute (force / pending span / latest
//      freshness-critical day).
//   2. Build / refresh the first primitive, `sleep_session_candidates`, from a
//      bounded overlap window only when needed.
//   3. Load the exact calendar-day substrate + exact sleep-window substrate for
//      the target day, then build one PreparedDerivationDay from those pieces.
//   4. Run the pure day pipeline off-isolate, then compute the second
//      primitive, `wake_day_features`, directly from the local-day substrate.
//   5. Persist day_result as the materialized UI surface, plus compact baseline
//      artifacts (`rolling_artifact`, `crossday_input`) for downstream reuse.
//   6. Run cross-day / notifications from those compact artifacts and prune raw
//      only after a force/full-history sweep, never before derived.
//
// Finalized-day rescans are still allowed for baseline-dependent scalars
// (readiness/recovery, illness/anomaly, stress), but they now gate off the
// rolling baseline artifact instead of recomputing the signature ad hoc from
// metric_series each time.

/// Analytics/bundle version — bump to force a recompute of non-finalized days.
/// v3: Walch 2019 stager + 4-class stages (light/deep/rem), robust nocturnal HRV,
/// 0–21 strain, skin-temp-z baseline fix, baseline-need signals.
/// v4: finalization + retention anchored on the DATA EDGE (last drained record
/// timestamp), not the wall clock — a buffer-and-sync band's wall-clock time is
/// irrelevant. Bumping resets per-version finalization so any day the old wall-
/// clock logic prematurely LOCKED (before its flash fully drained) re-derives.
/// v5: sleep HR-dip is confidence-only — no longer relocates onset. Validated on
/// real data: the old trim shoved a true 02:15 onset to 02:41, discarding ~26
/// min of real early sleep. Window onset now stands; stager decides wake within.
/// v6: replaced the Walch ML stager with a transparent cardiorespiratory rule
/// stager (motion + HR + RMSSD vs the night's own baseline). Walch over-called
/// wake (solid night read 60% eff) and ignored RR; the rule stager uses RR and,
/// on real data, lifts a true solid night to ~94–99% eff with a plausible
/// light/deep/REM mix. Honest ESTIMATE (conf scales with RR coverage).
/// v7: CALENDAR-day model (local midnight→midnight) replaces wake-to-wake. A
/// day's sleep = the main sleep that ENDED that morning; recovery follows into
/// the day, strain = that day's waking activity. Deletes the wake-scan day
/// boundaries / 36 h horizon / back-extension; recompute = the calendar day(s)
/// new data touches. Day keys are now plain calendar dates.
/// v8: STRESS (Baevsky SI, windowed median → 0–100 score) + relative SpO₂
/// (overnight desaturation index) now computed, persisted to day_result +
/// metric_series, and surfaced (Today tiles, stress screen, day/week/month/3M
/// trends). Stress validated on real data (SI ~47–52, low/normal resting).
/// v9: ACTIVITY-MINUTES — coarse 1 Hz movement proxy (wrist orientation change;
/// 1 Hz can't do ENMO/steps — Nyquist). Persisted + trended. Validated on real
/// data (~477 active min on a full day). True step counts remain live-IMU only.
/// v10: active calories (Keytel), HR zones, nocturnal nadir/waking, sleep-need
/// 8 h default; activeMin stored as double (fixes the int→double? derive crash).
/// v11: SLEEP CYCLES corrected to Rosenblum 2024 "fractal cycles" (HRV-adapted):
/// peak-to-peak of the smoothed per-minute RMSSD series, NOT categorical REM-
/// episode counting. Validated on real data (4 / 2 cycles, ~90–100 min each).
/// v12: nocturnal nadir INSTANT (`sleeping_hr_nadir_ts`) added so the card shows
/// "NADIR @ HH:MM" instead of "@ -"; seam-side, getDayStrain now routes the
/// cross-day EWMA-ACWR `load` to the strain detail. Full seam↔screen audit.
/// v13: computable gaps filled — HRV stability (CV) + Poincaré irregular-beat
/// screen (pipeline), and engine-injected blocks: wear segments, waking
/// daytime-HRV timeline, nocturnal restlessness, and sleep periods (main+naps).
/// v14: trend scalars for sleep-stage minutes (rem/deep/light/tst) + lf_hf +
/// hrv_cv (→ metric_series); per-5-min day `activity_curve` for the "Your day"
/// timeline. (Peak/lowest-HR + their @times are computed seam-side from the HR
/// curve, no derived change.)
/// v15: efficiency + worn_min scalars → metric_series (sleep-efficiency & wear
/// trends); + _trendKey fixes (resting_hr→rhr, skin_temp→skin_temp_z, sleep→tst_min).
/// v16: ADDITIVE analytics surfaced into the bundle — (a) `clinical.strain_effort`
/// + `scalars.strain_effort`: a 0–100 Edwards zone-sum "effort" strain (Karvonen
/// %HRR over the per-second wake HR) beside the 0–21 headline; (b) top-level
/// `baselines` block: Winsorized-EWMA personal baselines (rhr/hrv/resp) with
/// z/delta/ratio + cold-start status; (c) `advanced_sleep` block: a 4-class
/// Cole–Kripke/DoG stager's main-session AASM metrics + hypnogram (parallel
/// ESTIMATE; the single-source `sleep` block stays the headline). Bumping
/// re-derives non-finalized recent days so the new blocks populate.
/// v17: STEPS (24/7 ESTIMATE = ambulatory-minutes × cadence, personalized by the
/// live 100 Hz pedometer's cadence calibration) + TOTAL DAILY ENERGY (TDEE via
/// HR-flex: Mifflin BMR floor + active Keytel surplus). New scalars `steps` +
/// `calories_total` → metric_series; `steps`/`calories_total` bundle blocks. 1 Hz
/// still can't COUNT steps (Nyquist) — real counts come from live streaming, which
/// also tunes this estimate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so they fill.
// v20: principled nap detection (van Hees immobility + HR-dip) → `naps` block +
// `nap_min` scalar; cross-day Sleep Coach (need/bedtime/cycle-wake/performance),
// Strain Coach (recovery-gated target), VO₂max + Fitness Age, all in the crossday
// bundle.
// v21: all-day HRV line (`series.hrv_day`, epoch rolling RMSSD over 24/7 RR).
// v22: all-day RESP line (`series.resp_day`, rolling RSA br/min) + relative
// SKIN-TEMP trend (`series.skin_temp_day`) for the Timeline graph.
// v23: all-day HRV (`series.hrv_day`) now rejects ectopic/missed-beat pairs
// (Malik 20% rule) + clips to ≤220 ms, killing the non-physiological 400+ ms
// spikes.
// v24: picks up the analytics sleep-algorithm rewrite (multi-session detection +
// bridging + main-session pick via AdvancedSleepStager). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days so past nights restage; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v25: 24/7 irregular-rhythm SCREEN (day-span RR → `irregular_rhythm_flag` +
// notification), heart-rate recovery (HRR) per auto-detected bout → `hrr_bpm`,
// breathing-rate variability (`brv_cv`/`brv_slope`), opt-in auto-workout
// SUGGESTIONS (workout_suggestions table + notification), and low-confidence
// WRIST ORIENTATION during sleep (NOT body position). Bumping re-derives
// non-finalized days; "Re-analyze data" restages all.
// v26: integration bump — the oxygen/workout PR externalized active-calorie
// compute to `Calories.activeEnergy` (Keytel + height term) without a version
// bump; combined with the v25 features above, bump so finalized days recompute
// onto the new calorie formula instead of silently carrying the old values.
// v27: WEAR fix — worn-time / coverage / on-off segments were defined as hr>0,
// which misreads daytime PPG drop-out as off-wrist and collapsed a 24 h-worn day
// to ~the sleep window (~7-8 h). Wear is now RECORD presence (gap-detected), in
// both the `worn_min` scalar (onehz_pipeline) and the `_wearBlock` detail. Bump
// so finalized days recompute the corrected wear ("Re-analyze data" restages all).
// v28: SLEEP rescue — manual sleep entry + HR-led fallback. When accel-led
// detection finds nothing, an HR-dip fallback now proposes a window (source
// 'auto_fallback', low confidence); a user can type/confirm a window
// (sleep_override table → source 'manual'/'confirmed') which force-derives even
// a finalized day. Bump so fallback-eligible days restage.
// v29: COUNTER-RESET RECOVERY. The decoded substrate now dedupes by timestamp
// (rec_ts, newest-wins) instead of by the strap counter, which resets on reboot
// and silently quarantined every post-reboot day (empty "today", strain –). The
// DB v17 migration (_rebuildCanonicalDecodedStore) rebuilt decoded_onehz/
// decoded_rr time-keyed, the write path REPLACEs on rec_ts, and the substrate
// loader falls back to decoding raw_records directly for ranges whose decoded
// rows are absent — so previously-quarantined days now have data. Bump so those
// days (and any finalized day derived while data was missing) recompute against
// the recovered substrate.
// v32: SLEEP-STAGE fix — the REM detector depended on a respiration signal
// (`resp`) that no real caller ever supplied (WHOOP 4's R24 record has no
// respiration-ADC channel), so it was unconditionally NaN and the primary
// REM rule could never fire — nights collapsed to almost-all-light. Also
// resolved a three-implementation ambiguity (`cardioStager` vs
// `AdvancedSleepStager` v1/v2 — only v1 was ever actually wired, despite
// `cardioStager` being the one documented as fixing Walch 2019's WAKE-bias)
// via a head-to-head comparison; `cardioStager` (StagingMethod.cardio) is now
// the wired default. ALSO in this same (unshipped) bump: `dailyStepEstimate`'s
// doc had always promised a "run of >= minBoutMin consecutive ambulatory
// minutes" bout gate that was never actually implemented — every minute that
// individually passed the ENMO+HR gate summed directly into steps, so a
// handful of scattered, non-contiguous minutes overnight (a brief HR lift
// during a turn-over) could report several thousand phantom steps the moment
// someone woke up having never walked. `minBoutMin` (default 3) is now a real
// gate. Bumping re-derives non-finalized days so past nights/days restage;
// ALREADY-FINALIZED history needs "Re-analyze data" to pick up BOTH corrected
// staging and corrected steps — this is the one bump so far where that's
// worth actually telling users about, since it affects months of history,
// not just going forward.
// v37: SLEEP-STAGE fix #2 (real-device root cause, not synthetic) — v32 fixed
// the dead REM path but a real overnight capture showed cardioStager still
// massively over-called WAKE (~6h on a night truth was ~3min) and under-
// called REM (~40min vs a ~2h42m truth). Root cause: BOTH the motion
// ("gravity 1 g reference") and HR ("sleeping HR baseline") features were
// single WHOLE-NIGHT scalars. This real device's decoded gravity-vector
// magnitude is NOT perfectly orientation-invariant — different STATIC sleep
// postures read up to ~13% apart in |accel| despite near-zero within-epoch
// variance (i.e. genuinely still), so 389/421 "big move" epochs that night
// were this artifact, not real movement, and produced WAKE blocks too long
// for Webster rescore to bridge back. Separately, the whole-night HR arousal
// threshold misread the sleep-onset HR-decay transient (elevated HR for the
// first ~60-90 min while settling) as sustained arousal. `cardio_stager.dart`
// now computes both references as LOCALLY-ADAPTIVE rolling windows, plus a
// local p25 (not median) floor specifically for the REM gate — REM recurs on
// ~90 min ultradian cycles and is a minority of any local window, so a local
// MEDIAN self-dilutes from REM's own periodic elevation. Verified on the real
// capture: wake 294->1 min, light 173->337 min, deep 26->58 min, rem 41->139
// min, against an Apple Watch Ultra ground truth of wake=3 light=330 deep=38
// rem=162 min for the same night. Bump so this genuinely different (much more
// accurate) staging recomputes; "Re-analyze data" needed for finalized nights.
// v38: audit-fix sweep, two changes actually touch output. (1) analytics'
// `readinessLnRmssd` was including tonight's own value in its own baseline
// window (`historyLnRmssd.sublist(start)` ran to the end of the list instead
// of stopping before it) - pulled the mean/sd toward tonight, understating
// how far off a genuinely suppressed/elevated night reads, worst exactly
// when the window is smallest. Now strictly prior nights only, changing
// `readiness_lnrmssd`'s z/cv/value for every day. (2) day windows here used
// `_localDayLabelToSec(day) + 86400`, assuming every local day is exactly
// 24h - wrong on the two DST-transition days a year (23h/25h), which could
// clip or over-include a day's substrate window right at the boundary. Now
// `_localNextDayLabelToSec` asks DateTime for the actual start of the next
// day. Bump so recent days recompute onto the corrected readiness baseline;
// only matters for history on the rare day that crossed a DST transition.
// v39: night-tail sleep runs shorter than the 60-min standalone floor are no
// longer dropped when they continue the overnight chain (advanced_stager
// detectSleep) — a pre-dawn arousal that split off a <60-min tail was
// truncating the sleep-window offset at the arousal. Bump so affected days
// recompute the corrected (later) offset and downstream sleep/readiness metrics.
// v42: PERSONALIZED, self-improving cardio stager. (1) REM feature upgrades in
// cardioStager — LF/HF from the RR Lomb–Scargle spectrum + R(k)=mean|ΔIHR|,
// OR-combined with the RMSSD drop and gated by atonia + an HR floor (recovers
// under-called REM), plus a 3-epoch median flicker filter. (2) A rolling
// per-user sleep profile (baselines key `sleep_user_profile`) EWMA-folded after
// each finalized night and blended (bounded ≤0.5, growing with nights, 0 at
// cold start) with tonight's per-night-local baselines — so staging gets better
// over time while per-night-local always leads. Deep stays a low-confidence
// NREM sub-split (deep_low_confidence). The profile self-seeds across this
// re-derivation sweep; no explicit migration. Bump so every day re-stages.
// v43: readinessComposite now falls back to a mean/SD z when the robust (median
// +MAD) z is degenerate (MAD==0 on a tightly-clustered quantized baseline —
// whole-bpm RHR / integer skin-temp ADC), which was intermittently blanking the
// whole readiness score to "—" on nights that had valid sleep. Bump so days that
// were previously absent-for-that-reason recompute a real score.
// v44: two consistency fixes; neither changes a scalar that a previously
// FINALIZED day_result already had right, but both affect data availability/
// consistency going forward. (1) A day whose offloaded second-half compute
// (naps/workouts/HRR/wear/curves/wake-features) failed or timed out — but
// whose headline scalars (readiness/RHR/RMSSD) already succeeded — could get
// marked finalized and treated as fully "derived" by the raw-pruning guard,
// permanently losing the raw substrate needed to ever fill in those missing
// fields on retry. Now tracked via a new `partial` day_result column and
// excluded from both age-based finalization and the pruning guard until the
// second half actually completes. (2) The wake_day_features early-read
// artifact (what the Today repo shows before the full day result is ready)
// was copying the pre-hybrid-correction 1Hz-only step/calorie estimate
// instead of the corrected real-100Hz+1Hz hybrid value computed moments
// later in the same pass — the final day_result was always correct, only
// this transient early read was stale. Bump so any day currently sitting
// non-finalized re-derives with both fixes in effect.
// v45: cardioStager REM LF/HF hot-path fix. `_windowRemFeatures` fed ABSOLUTE
// epoch seconds (~1.75e9) into the per-30-s-epoch Lomb–Scargle, forcing every
// sin/cos onto libm's __kernel_rem_pio2 multi-precision slow path. Over a full
// night (~1000 epochs × 240 freqs × ~180 beats × 2 loops) that is tens of
// millions of slow-path trig calls — and because v42 runs staging on the MAIN
// isolate (for the ambient profile blend), it landed on the UI thread and
// produced recurring multi-second freezes → Android ANRs (Crashlytics 0.9.13:
// libm.so __kernel_rem_pio2 / sin / cos, "slow operations in main thread").
// Fix rebases beat times to the window start; L-S is time-shift invariant so
// LF/HF is unchanged in exact arithmetic (only last-ULP float differences, which
// is why a bump is warranted). Bump so non-finalized days re-stage on the fast
// path. Paired with this: `_sleepCandidateForDay` now runs the whole staging +
// profile-fold on a WORKER isolate (the analytics ambient profile globals are
// re-armed inside the `Isolate.run` closure and returned as plain JSON) instead
// of the main/UI thread — so the residual staging CPU no longer blocks the UI
// even before the ~10× trig win.
// v46: readiness-blank-"—" fix — `_seriesMean` trailing-28 window fix +
// analytics re-pin picking up the `robustZ`->`z` fallback (v43 above,
// analytics#26) so quantized baselines with MAD==0 stop intermittently
// blanking a legitimate score.
// v47: readiness's RHR input (`rhrToday` in onehz_pipeline.dart) no longer
// accepts the `rhr` metric's daytime-HR fallback — it now requires an actual
// detected sleep session (`hasSleep && sleepHr.isNotEmpty`), matching how
// HRV/resp/temp were already gated. Previously a no-sleep day could still
// produce a full numeric readiness score off RHR alone (a few minutes of live
// daytime HR masquerading as overnight resting HR), which is how a fresh
// install could show "Readiness 100" ~10 minutes after first wearing the
// strap. Also removed `getDayStress`'s `100 - readiness` fallback in
// local_repository_impl.dart — it fabricated a stress-looking number whenever
// the real Baevsky SI was absent, violating the never-impute rule; the UI
// already correctly renders "—" when `score` is null. Bump so affected days
// re-derive without a same-day, no-sleep readiness/stress score.
// v48: audit sweep across compute + the sibling analytics package.
//
// EDGE-LOCAL changes, which ship the moment this constant lands:
//   - The per-sweep baseline snapshot is genuinely frozen. `appendScalars` is
//     gone; the history is dated and loaded once, and `valuesBefore(key, date)`
//     excludes the target day from its own baseline. A re-derive sweep could
//     previously append each finished day back into the shared window and evict
//     a real old day, collapsing median/MAD toward duplicated recent values —
//     the same pollution shape edge#108 fixed on the load path.
//   - A day is no longer allowed to sit inside its own readiness baseline, and
//     lnRMSSD no longer double-appends today.
//   - `nocturnalRhr` is now fed the positionally-dense day series instead of a
//     compacted one, so its 30-minute window is real wall-clock again.
//   - Profile imputation (age 30 / 70 kg / sex m / RHR 60) no longer persists
//     strain, calories and zones as if they were measured.
//   - SRI no longer drops the one hypnogram segment per night that crosses
//     local midnight; CTL/ATL/TSB now sees a calendar-dense series so fitness
//     and fatigue decay across rest days.
//   - Historical days resolve their timezone offset at their own timestamp
//     rather than through today's offset.
//
// SIBLING-PACKAGE changes ride along with this bump: the analytics sweep from
// the same review (sleep no longer reporting a no-data window as light sleep,
// the Lipponen-Tarvainen threshold on the signed dRR series, abstention on
// degenerate dispersion, the reconciled TRIMP stack, circular social jetlag)
// and the protocol decode fixes. This was NOT true when v48 was first written —
// pubspec.yaml still pointed at the pre-fix SHAs then, and this note said so.
// The pins were moved as part of v49; see the pin-status note above it.
// v49: steps/activity rebuilt on a calibration-invariant feature.
//
// Diagnosed on a real user database: the day reported 39,384 steps against a
// true value of ~2,000. ENMO is `mean(max(0, |a| - gRef))` and gRef is
// auto-calibrated per day from the stillest samples — which are the long sleep
// block, where the wrist sits in a different orientation. gRef came out at
// 0.9797 that day vs ~1.032 on every other, and since ENMO subtracts it from
// every sample, a reference 0.05 g low adds 0.05 g to every minute: exactly the
// 0.05 g walking floor. Sweeping gRef over the identical samples gave 42,155
// steps at 0.97 and 0 at 1.02 — the signal and the calibration error are both
// ~0.05 g, so no threshold could have fixed it.
//
// The analytics package now decides activity from the per-axis high-passed
// dynamic amplitude (gravity is DC in the sensor frame; any per-axis offset or
// gain error cancels exactly), anchored on a PERSONAL floor pooled from
// trailing days rather than an absolute constant or a same-day baseline — both
// of which were measured to fail, in opposite directions.
//
// Edge side of that change:
//   - `dyn_p90` joins the baseline series: each day persists its own high
//     quantile of the dynamic amplitude, and the next day's derive takes the
//     MEDIAN across trailing days (self-excluded, like every other baseline) as
//     its floor. Below the minimum history the estimator ABSTAINS — a day with
//     no personal baseline now reports the real 100 Hz count only, instead of a
//     fabricated 1 Hz number.
//   - `active_min` is persisted as a first-class series. Minutes are what 1 Hz
//     can resolve; steps are derived from them as a range.
//   - The steps bundle carries the range + the floor used, and says plainly
//     when the 1 Hz estimate is absent.
//
// This bump also re-derives days whose stored step figure came from the old
// estimator.
//
// PIN STATUS: as of this bump pubspec.yaml points at the analytics and protocol
// PR-branch commits, so everything described in v48 AND v49 is genuinely in the
// build — the edge code physically cannot compile against the older analytics
// pin, which is how we know. Those pins must move to the merge commits (and
// this must bump again) when the sibling PRs land. Verify any analytics claim
// made here with `git show <pinned-sha>:<file>` before trusting it; a changelog
// citing a change the pinned SHA never contained is how v43 documented a
// readiness fix that stayed broken for three releases.

// v50: the sibling PRs merged; pubspec.yaml now pins the resulting `main`
// commits (analytics f5ccae6, protocol a98cd70) instead of the PR-branch heads
// v49 briefly pointed at.
//
// A version bump is required even though no edge SOURCE line changed with it.
// kAlgoVersion identifies the code that PRODUCED a day_result, and that code
// includes the pinned siblings: a device holding v49 rows built against the
// PR-branch SHAs must re-derive against the merged ones rather than serve them
// as equivalent. Treating "same content, different commit" as not worth a bump
// is the assumption that lets a stale bundle survive a dependency change.
//
// Verified at the merge commits themselves, not inferred from the PRs being
// green: steps.dart carries the new step API, rr_correction.dart has the
// signed-dRR `seg.add(x[k])`, advanced_stager.dart has maxAccelCarryForwardSec,
// live.dart has kKnownRecordVersions.

// v51: edge#170 — autoDetectWorkouts' motion-confirmation gate (tuned for
// arm-swing activities) silently dropped every low-limb-swing cardio window
// (cycling/rowing: the wrist stays still on a handlebar/oar) no matter how
// strong the HR signal was. analytics#32 (PR-branch head, pinned above —
// repin to main once merged) adds an HR-ONSET bypass: the gate is skipped
// only when mean bpm over the candidate's first 3 min rises >=25 bpm versus
// the 3 min immediately before it (Whipp & Wasserman 1972 phase-II kinetics),
// which fires on genuine exercise starts but NOT on slow-drifting elevations
// (fever/heat/anxiety) that have no discernible onset — so this changes which
// suggestions autoDetectWorkouts emits without loosening the false-positive
// gate it exists to protect.
// v52: the rolling per-user sleep profile (`sleep_user_profile`) was folded on
// EVERY staging pass for a day, not once per day — a real 12-day export carried
// `nights: 1348`. Two consequences, both bad: `personalWeight` pinned at its
// 0.5 cap from the first sweep, and an EWMA collapsed onto whichever day was
// re-derived last. Replaying that profile against the same 11 nights moved wake
// 4.3% -> 36.4% and deep 1.9% -> 0.0% on the worst night, i.e. the
// personalization layer was re-creating the wake over-call cardioStager exists
// to avoid. Fixed by (1) folding at most once per day_id (tracked in the
// profile payload), (2) withholding the profile from staging until
// kMinNightsForSleepProfile nights (van der Aar 2025: gains need >=3 nights and
// ~17.5% of subjects get WORSE from personalization), and (3) discarding
// pre-tracking profiles, which cannot be repaired, so they rebuild honestly.
// Bump so every day re-stages without the corrupt blend.
// v53: repin analytics to main @ #34 — the sleep-stager decision layer is
// rewritten. Deep and REM were boolean conjunctions AND-ing one informative
// axis with one null one (rmssd, Cohen's d -0.13 deep / -0.02 REM) and one
// INVERTED one (mean HR, d +0.31 for deep, i.e. deep sleep runs slightly
// FASTER than light on the wrist), so all three could only co-fire by
// coincidence — which is why deep sleep came out as isolated 30-second specks
// that the 3-min minimum-bout rule then deleted. Scored against 99 PSG-labelled
// wrist nights those rules managed kappa 0.036, with deep PPV 5.7% against a
// 4.5% base rate and REM 12.1% against 14.0% — at or below chance for both.
// Now weighted robust-z scores (weights = the measured effect sizes) over
// Rk / hrSd / sdnn / lfhf, with rmssd and mean HR dropped: kappa 0.128, 0.132
// on held-out subjects, deep 53.0/12.9 and REM 52.6/20.7 sens/PPV. Every day's
// hypnogram, stage minutes and sleep-derived scalars change, so every day must
// re-derive. Also picks up the protocol realtimeRr bound (live HRV no longer
// sees implausible sub-100ms "beats" from a misaligned 0x28 frame).
// v54: NOOP CSV imports now bank the export's `step_counter` as REAL steps.
// NOOP's schema gained a `steps` stream (and a `band_sleep_state` column that
// shifted event_kind/event_payload) — the importer read columns by name so it
// never misparsed, but it dropped `steps` into its default branch and every
// imported day reported steps = 0 while the band had actually counted them
// (2,572 over the 3.5 h in the OpenStrap/edge#160 export). The counter is now
// differenced into contiguous runs and written to `live_coverage`, the same
// table the live 100 Hz pedometer uses, so imported and live days count steps
// identically and the 1 Hz estimate still cannot double-count those minutes.
// Only the `steps`/`active_min` block of IMPORTED days changes; no live-sync
// output moves. NOTE this bump does not retro-fix an existing import — imported
// days are force-finalized snapshots with no stored raw to recompute from, so
// an already-imported day needs a re-import to pick its steps up.
// v55: NAPS. Daytime naps were "detected" by the NOCTURNAL detector, which
// rejects them on purpose — `AdvancedSleepStager.minSleepMin = 60` exists so
// "daytime naps and stray still-blocks stay excluded", and anything centred
// 11:00–20:00 local additionally needed ≥90 min plus an HR dip. So the 20–45
// min afternoon nap was STRUCTURALLY undetectable, and `detectNaps` advertised
// a 20-min floor it could never reach, returning an empty list with a
// reassuring (and false) "no qualifying naps (20 min–3 h)" note.
//
// SIBLING (analytics): new `sleep/nap.dart` — the only nap source. Enumerates
// every van Hees z-angle immobility bout on the complement of the main sleep
// window (an ANGLE, so it does not inherit the ~13% |accel| spread across
// static postures), requires an HR dip against the AWAKE-DAYTIME baseline
// rather than a night-dominated whole-day median, and reports TST and in-bed
// separately. No sleep-stage claim: a 30-min nap holds no complete cycle and
// the daytime HR duty cycle will not support a 4-class partition. The shared
// immobility primitive is factored out as `immobilityMask` so night and nap
// run one implementation. Specifics worth knowing:
//   - The awake baseline excludes the main sleep AND every detected bout. It
//     cannot include the candidate's own seconds or the hours of tonight's
//     sleep the nap window borrows, or the dip gate becomes self-suppressing —
//     the quieter the sleep, the lower the bar it must beat.
//   - Under 10 min of awake HR, the day is not judged at all. A median over a
//     handful of samples is not a baseline, and every verdict hangs off it.
//   - Durations are WALL CLOCK, not sample counts. The substrate is a
//     positional array with pruning/sync holes, so a run also breaks at a
//     timestamp discontinuity; otherwise an unobserved hour reads as unbroken
//     stillness and 20 min of evidence reports a 2 h nap.
//   - Deferral is CHAIN-aware. Deferring only the bout that touches the array
//     end is not enough: an ordinary 6-min awakening at 01:50 splits tonight's
//     sleep, and only the trailing half touches the end. Every bout chained to
//     an unfinished one (within napChainGapSec) is unfinished too.
// Verify the analytics pin actually contains this before shipping the bump
// (AGENTS §3.5).
//
// EDGE-LOCAL changes, which ship the moment this constant lands:
//   - `_sleepPeriods` no longer runs its OWN nap detector (20-min stillness
//     runs). That second notion disagreed with `detectNaps` on real days —
//     the committed `payload.json` shows a 21-minute period alongside
//     `naps.count: 0` — and fed a different screen. One source now (§3.8).
//   - Periods speak the contract the Sleep-periods screen actually reads
//     (`onset_ts`/`wake_ts`/`duration_min`/`efficiency`), which it never did:
//     every nap card rendered "0m" with a red confidence dot regardless of
//     what was detected. `duration_min` is minutes ASLEEP for both the main
//     sleep and naps, which were previously different units under one label.
//   - `nap_min` is TST, not the in-bed span. It is subtracted 1:1 from sleep
//     need, so crediting in-bed minutes over-credited every nap by its awake
//     time and always erred toward recommending LESS sleep.
//   - An unfinished bout is DEFERRED, not emitted (see the sibling notes). With
//     a 3 h post-midnight buffer the first hours of TONIGHT'S sleep were being
//     written as a multi-hour "nap" for the day that was ending, then counted
//     again as tomorrow's main sleep.
//   - The main sleep period's TST/efficiency are carried into the day-blocks
//     isolate. That isolate builds its own `scMap` seeded with `rhr` alone, so
//     reading `scMap['tst_min']` there yields null forever — which would have
//     made every main-sleep card read "—". Efficiency is normalized from the
//     stored percent to the 0..1 the card contract uses.
//   - `total_asleep_min` is null when any listed period's minutes are unknown.
//     Summing a null as 0 printed a confident total short by exactly the part
//     we could not measure, and the hero arc divides by it.
//   - `sleep_coach.nap_credit_min` is the credit ACTUALLY applied, not the raw
//     nap minutes: `sleepNeed` clamps to [6 h, 11 h] after subtracting, so a
//     large credit is only partly realized.
//   - Today-scoped reads require an explicit `is_today` stamp on the cross-day
//     record. Taking the last record positionally is yesterday on any day whose
//     row has not been derived yet.
//   - Off-wrist and charging spans are passed to the detector from the strap's
//     own WRIST_OFF/WRIST_ON and CHARGING_ON/OFF events. These were decoded
//     and persisted to `band_events` all along and never used; a band on a
//     table or charger is motionless and is the dominant nap false positive.
//   - Absent ≠ zero: when nap detection cannot judge a day, `nap_min` is left
//     UNWRITTEN, and the sleep-need credit reads TODAY only. It previously
//     fell back through `_lastNum` to YESTERDAY's nap minutes (§3.3).
//   - `sleep_coach.nap_credit_min` exposes the credit that was subtracted, so
//     the coach card can show it instead of silently shrinking the ring.
//
// Days re-derive so naps, nap_min, sleep_periods and sleep need are rebuilt.
// v56: the STRAIN half of the same today-scoping bug. v55 fixed `nap_min` but
// left `sleep_coach.need`'s other today-scoped input reading through
// `_lastNum`, so a day whose strain compute abstained built tonight's strain
// bonus out of an EARLIER day's workout — the identical §3.3 imputation, in the
// identical function, two lines apart. Measured on a 7-day fixture: a carried
// strain of 18 inflated `need_sec` by 2314 s (38.6 min) over a today-abstained
// day. Now `_todayNum`.
//
// Direction note, because it differs from v55 and the difference matters: naps
// are SUBTRACTED and strain is ADDED, so while both inputs floor at 0, that
// floor is an upper bound on need for naps and a LOWER bound for strain.
// Abstaining to 0 strain therefore recommends up to 45 min LESS sleep, not
// more. It is still correct — carrying yesterday forward is not a safety margin
// but noise around the true value (it inflates need only when yesterday
// happened to be harder than today), and strain is a same-day accumulating
// quantity that genuinely starts at 0 — but it is not the cautious direction.
// Because it is not, it is not allowed to be silent either:
//   - `sleep_coach.strain_bonus_min` reports the minutes the bonus ACTUALLY
//     added, measured like `nap_credit_min` (re-run with strain zeroed and
//     diff), so the [6 h, 11 h] clamp cannot make the card claim an increase
//     `need_sec` never took.
//   - It is NULL, never 0, when today produced no strain reading. A confident 0
//     says "you rested"; null says "we could not measure today's strain, so
//     tonight's need is short by up to 45 min". Collapsing those would re-hide
//     exactly what the today-scoping fix exposed.
//   - The Sleep Coach card renders the applied bonus as a "+Xm added for
//     today's strain" line (`strainBonusCaption`), mirroring the nap credit.
//     The card stays SILENT on null, matching the nap precedent — surfacing
//     "today's strain was not measured" to the user is a product decision, and
//     the bundle carries the distinction for whoever takes it.
//
// Days re-derive so sleep need, bedtime, wake and sleep performance are rebuilt.

// NOTE ON NUMBERING: v55 and v56 above are the nap/strain work (PR #204),
// which merged first. The three entries below are this branch's, renumbered
// from 55/56/57 to 57/58/59 so the constant stays STRICTLY MONOTONIC. That is
// load-bearing, not cosmetic: the derive gate matches algo_version EXACTLY
// while the read seam serves MAX(algo_version), so a version that goes
// backwards writes rows nobody reads and re-derives forever.
//
// v57: THE 1 Hz STEP ESTIMATE IS DELETED. Steps are now real-measured only.
//
// Diagnosis on a real user DB (2026-08-03): the app reported 2,645 steps for a
// day the user took under 400. It was 23 "active minutes" x an assumed 115 spm.
// Both halves of that conversion are invalid at 1 Hz, and neither is fixable by
// re-tuning:
//   * Cadence is NOT IDENTIFIABLE. Gait is 1.4-2.3 Hz (Straczkiewicz 2023,
//     doi:10.1038/s41746-022-00745-z); at 1 Hz every fundamental is sub-Nyquist
//     and 80/100/140/160 spm alias to the same 0.333 Hz. No published step
//     detector exists below 10 Hz.
//   * The minutes were never specifically ambulation. At the wrist, arm work
//     out-accelerates walking (stirring ~104 mg, chopping ~139 mg vs walking
//     ~66 mg ENMO), so a movement threshold cannot isolate gait even at full
//     rate: wrist devices emit 22-27 false steps/min during dishes, reaching
//     and driving (O'Connell 2017, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0169616) while
//     detecting slow walking at sensitivity 0.05. The two errors have OPPOSITE
//     sign, so no gain constant corrects both.
// Confirmed against this DB's own ground truth: the single window where the
// 100 Hz pedometer and 1 Hz overlap had HR 95->108 and dynAmp 0.31-0.40 g, and
// the REAL count was 11 steps in 3.1 min (3.5 spm) where the estimator would
// have assigned ~115 spm.
//
// What changes: `scalars.steps` is now ABSENT unless a gait-capable source
// measured the day (band 100 Hz, phone pedometer, or a NOOP import — all in
// `live_coverage`). Days with no such source lose their step number entirely
// rather than showing an invented one. `active_min` survives as an explicitly
// NON-locomotion movement-volume index (bundle key `movement`) and is no longer
// coverage-excluded, since there is no longer a step total it could double-count
// into. Steps also stopped being written to Apple Health / Health Connect, both
// because the old value was fabricated and because we now READ the phone's own
// pedometer from that store and must not feed our copy back to ourselves.
// Every day's steps/active_min move, so every day must re-derive.
// v58: movement minutes rebuilt on MEASURED evidence. Every change below was
// proven against 4 days of this user's real 1 Hz substrate before being made;
// two proposals were REFUTED by the same tests and deliberately NOT built.
//
//   * HR GATE DELETED. `restingHr + 8 bpm` changed active minutes by exactly
//     ZERO on every day tested. At RHR ~62 it sits at ~6% of heart-rate
//     reserve — below every ACSM band — and 73-100% of covered minutes already
//     cleared it. It also failed in the wrong direction: PPG HR is least
//     reliable during the motion being gated, so a dropout deleted minutes the
//     accelerometer measured fine. `dailyActiveMinutes` no longer accepts HR.
//   * x3 CEILING DELETED. It rejected ZERO minutes on all 4 days with
//     0.42-0.55 g of headroom, and cannot fire on artifacts (a 3 s knock
//     averages ~0.23 g, below the FLOOR). The only thing it could ever exclude
//     was a genuinely hard session.
//   * FLOOR IS NOW FROZEN after a 14-day enrollment, not recomputed daily. A
//     threshold derived from the signal it thresholds cancels the trend it
//     exists to report: scaling a real day's dynAmp gave 37 active minutes at
//     1x, 1.5x, 2x AND 3x activity when recomputed, versus 23 -> 254 frozen.
//     Re-freezes only on device/wrist change, a 30-day wear gap, or 365 days.
//   * NOT BUILT (proven unnecessary): accel autocalibration — offset and
//     uniform gain cancel exactly through the high-pass and the floor
//     normalisation (+5% gain moves the gate decision by 0.0000); only
//     anisotropic gain survives at ~1-3%. And gravity/forearm orientation —
//     it solved the ambulation problem v55 deleted. A sleep-anchored floor was
//     also tested and REFUTED: CV 138.6% across days vs 9.3%, and on one night
//     it landed above the entire day's range (would report zero).
//   * SEMANTICS CORRECTED. The R24 1 Hz accel field is a fused GRAVITY vector,
//     not acceleration: across 269,486 real samples ||a|| is p50 1.027 g with
//     0.030% above 1.3 g, and during the single most vigorous minute of a day
//     it was 1.033 g +- 0.006 (0 of 420 samples above 1.2 g). So `dynAmp`
//     measures how fast the wrist RE-ORIENTS, not how hard it accelerates, and
//     ENMO/MAD over this substrate are ~(1.03 - gRef): a pure calibration
//     artifact with zero signal. That is the true root cause of the original
//     42,155-steps-at-gRef-0.97 / 0-at-1.02 collapse.
// active_min moves on every day; steps are unaffected by this bump.
//
// v59 - review follow-up: the ABSENT `steps` block stops labelling itself. It
//   carried `tier: 'ESTIMATE'` alongside `value: null`, and `Metric.parse` maps
//   that tier to `beta: true`, so a day with no measurement at all rendered the
//   estimate badge. Absent now means absent: `tier: null` (parsing to
//   MetricTier.unknown) and an empty `inputs_used`. No VALUE changes, but the
//   persisted bundle does, so days derived at v58 must be re-derived to pick it
//   up. `ABSENT` was deliberately NOT invented as a fifth tier — `Tier.all` in
//   analytics is a closed set of four published grades.
//
// v60 - the all-day HRV and respiratory curves advance their cadence cursor on
//   every ATTEMPT rather than only on a successful estimate. `_dayRespCurve`
//   left `lastEmit` unset whenever rsaRespRate came back absent — and absent is
//   the EXPECTED daytime case, because daytime RSA is movement-confounded — so a
//   confounded stretch re-ran the triple Lomb-Scargle once per beat instead of
//   once per five minutes. That is what exhausted the 90 s day-blocks budget and
//   left days persisted headline-only. `_dayHrvCurve` had the same shape plus an
//   O(window) sum that ran before its cadence gate was checked. Both curves keep
//   their sampling intent; points that were previously emitted a beat or two
//   after a failed attempt now land on the next cadence tick instead.
// v61 - NAP EDITS. The nap detector's answer is now a PROPOSAL: a nap the user
//   logged is added, and one they rejected is suppressed, replayed over the
//   detector's output on every derivation rather than written into it (so a
//   better detector later still respects "there was no nap here"). Rejection
//   matches by OVERLAP, not by exact bounds, because the detector's boundaries
//   shift between runs and an edit that stopped applying when a boundary moved
//   by a minute would be worse than useless.
//
//   This moves numbers, which is why it is a version bump rather than a read
//   path: `nap_min` is summed over the merged list, so a logged nap credits
//   against sleep need and sleep debt exactly as a detected one does — that
//   was the explicit product decision, not an accident of where the code sat.
//   Days carrying an edit are force-derived alongside sleep-override days, so
//   an edit to an already-finalized day actually takes effect.
// v62 - imported WHOOP/cloud snapshots now seed the canonical `ln_rmssd`
//   baseline, and a finalized snapshot yields when measured 1 Hz data later
//   arrives for the same date. Until the measured result is complete and
//   settled, the snapshot stays intact instead of being replaced by thin data.
