// `kAdapterSignals` is KEPT IN SYNC BY HAND with each adapter's own `signals`
// declaration — `_registry.dart` says so, and explains why (importing the
// three adapters back into the file they all import their `BandEntry` from
// would be a cycle for three lines of data). A hand-synced table with no test
// is a table that drifts, and the drift is invisible: `declaredSignals` is
// what decides whether a device is a candidate for a metric at all, so a
// missing entry reads as "this band cannot measure that" rather than as a bug.
//
// A test has no cycle to worry about, so it compares both sides directly:
// membership AND the declared cadence.
